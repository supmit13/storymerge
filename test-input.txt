1. What time of day is blood pressure highest?

Usually, blood pressure starts to rise a few hours before a person wakes up. It continues to rise during the day, peaking in midday. Blood pressure typically drops in the late afternoon and evening. Blood pressure is usually lower at night while sleeping.

2. How to Lower Blood Pressure Naturally

Regular Physical Activity Helps Improve Health

It’s no secret that regular physical activity helps to keep you in good health. Not only does exercise help control high blood pressure, it also helps you manage your weight, strengthen your heart and lower your stress level. While any type of aerobic activity (walking, jogging, dancing) has a positive impact on heart health, try to find something you enjoy doing. This will make it easier to commit to a regular routine and will motivate you to get up and moving.

3. Eat Less Salt

Most people eat too much salt without realizing it. The American Heart Association estimates that the average American eats about 3,400 mg of sodium a day. However, the recommended daily intake is 2,300 mg, with an ideal limit of less than 1,500 mg per day, especially for those with high blood pressure.

4. To decrease sodium in your diet, try these tips:

Read food labels. Look for “low salt” or “low sodium” versions of the food and beverages you normally buy.
Eat fewer processed foods. Only a small amount of sodium naturally occurs in foods. Nearly 70 percent of the sodium we eat comes from processed, prepackaged and restaurant foods.
Don’t add salt. Just 1 teaspoon of salt contains 2,300 mg of sodium. Use salt substitutes such as spices, garlic, herbs and other seasonings in place of some or all of the salt to add flavor to your favorite dishes.

5. Add More Potassium to Your Diet to Reduce High Blood Pressure

Not only does potassium help regulate heart rate, it can also reduce the effects of sodium in the body.
The most effective way to increase your potassium intake is by adjusting your diet, as opposed to taking supplements. Potassium-rich foods include:
Fruits like bananas, melons, oranges, apricots, avocados and tomatoes
Milk, yogurt and cream cheese
Leafy green vegetables, potatoes and sweet potatoes
Tuna and salmon
Beans
Nuts and seeds

6. Limit Your Alcohol Consumption

Some research shows that drinking alcohol in moderation can benefit your heart. However, too much alcohol consumed at one time can cause a sudden spike in your blood pressure.
If you’re currently taking medication to treat high blood pressure, you should be especially mindful of your alcohol intake.

7. Reduce Your Stress to Lower Your Blood Pressure

We all have stress in our day to day lives a flat tire in the middle of rush hour, a looming deadline at work that can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure. In most cases, once the stressful situation is resolved, your heart rate and blood pressure return to normal.
However, chronic stress may put you at risk for a variety of long-term health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. Stress can also increase your blood pressure levels if your coping mechanisms involve eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
While it’s impossible to eliminate all stressors from your life, learning to cope with them in a healthier way can make a positive impact on your health and wellness—which can in turn lower your blood pressure.

8. Some methods to help alleviate or deal with stress include:

Reframing your mindset. Focus on the things you can control, instead of worrying about situations that are out of your hands. Many times, our anxieties stem from the “what if” instances that might not ever occur. Putting those thoughts into perspective and reminding yourself to stay present can help calm those worries.
Avoid stress triggers. Try to avoid putting yourself in unnecessary stressful situations. For example, try leaving for work a few minutes early to beat rush-hour traffic.
Practice gratitude. Acknowledging all the positives in our lives often helps to shift the focus away from what we want or what we are lacking. In addition, outwardly expressing gratitude to others can also help reduce feelings of stress.
Take time to relax and enjoy. Carve out time for things that bring you joy. Whether that’s eating a good meal, spending time with loved ones or listening to an interesting podcast on your commute, find time to incorporate small moments of enjoyment throughout the day.
It’s important to note that if you have prolonged hypertension, your treatment may require both healthy lifestyle changes like these, along with care and medications as prescribed by your physician. Talk to your doctor for specific advice on how to lower your blood pressure.
